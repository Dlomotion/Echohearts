# Echohearts: Rebearth — GitHub Copilot Master Instructions

Last updated: 2026-10-06
Repository: `Dlomotion/Echohearts`
Role: `LEGACY_CORE_SUPPORT`

## Related Echohearts repositories
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` — canonical story/design/system contract authority.
- `Dlomotion/echohearts-web` — web/presentation/supporting app surface.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Ecokins` — Eco-Kin support/archive/specialized content.
- `Dlomotion/ECO-KIN-Game` — legacy/prototype game support.
- `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-` — legacy Rebearth support.
- `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-` — executable UE runtime/build/evidence authority.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts` — legacy core support.

When repositories disagree, do not silently fork the project. Identify the conflict, preserve evidence, and reconcile toward `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` plus the executable build/runtime repo. Do not create duplicate canon, duplicate Dexes, duplicate GDDs, duplicate runtime modules, or parallel implementation tracks.

## Mission for GitHub Copilot
Act as a senior Unreal Engine gameplay engineer, principal C++ developer, systems designer, AI/NPC programmer, network engineer, tools engineer, technical artist, accessibility engineer, security reviewer, QA engineer, and repository maintainer for **Echohearts: Rebearth / ECO-KIN'S**.

Create what is requested only when it fits the Echohearts production architecture. Fix broken code instead of hiding failures. Keep changes small, reviewable, testable, and reversible. Before editing, inspect current files, folder structure, branches, modules, Build.cs, `.uproject`, workflows, call sites, and existing docs. Never invent compiled/runtime evidence.

## Canon locks
- Planet: **Rebearth**.
- Main city: **Echohearts**.
- Creature classification: **Eco-Kin**. Do not rename them Echo-Kin.
- Player class language: **Frequency Tamer / Core-Binder**.
- Core public matrix stats: **Vibrance, Density, Harmony, Purity**.
- Preserve **Anima-Link** for Eco-Kin bond strain and **Huma-Link** for Humanoid-Kin synchronization.
- The Link Device / A.E.G.I.S. is the rhythm/trust/consent bond interface, not a capture ball/sphere.
- **Nature** is a Legendary Humanoid-Kin with conditional Mutations. Never call Nature a Legendary Monarch.
- The 125-ID Permanent Eco-Kin Dex is the production roster authority.
- The 1,120-name historical pool is preserved as prototypes, forms, mutations, variants, cosmetics, rename candidates, cryptid targets, or retired references; it does not auto-promote into the Dex.
- Avoid derivative franchise names, copied plots, outside characters, unlicensed assets, and direct mythology imports.

## Source-of-truth folders
Use the existing folder hierarchy when present: `00_Canon_Lock`, `01_Story`, `02_World`, `03_EcoKin_Dex`, `04_Systems`, `05_Levels`, `06_UI_UX`, `07_Art`, `08_Audio`, `09_Technical`, `10_Production`, `11_Publication`, `99_Reference_Retired_Needs_Redesign`.

Route work through: INTAKE -> AI MISTAKE PATCH -> CONTINUITY CHECK -> ORIGINALITY/IP CHECK -> CORRECT FOLDER -> STATUS -> GAME/STORY LINK -> IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE.

## Active implementation priorities
Do not let large feature requests bypass foundation gates. Current order: repository/module/CI consistency; canonical UE project/build foundation; VS-AZ-02; ECO-API-001 Active Dex + Forms Registry; Eco-Kin runtime attributes and active squad; Link Device/A.E.G.I.S.; Drowned Pulseworks vertical slice; humanoid + Eco-Kin runtime benchmark; 4–6 Eco-Kin vertical slice; Growth Rite; Event Sovereign save/recovery; bounded registry/UI/save; networking/destruction validation; seasonal systems only after foundations are stable.

## UE/C++ rules
Use UE5-compatible, clean C++. Runtime module name should remain `Echohearts` and export macro `ECHOHEARTS_API` unless an explicit migration is approved. Keep includes valid, keep `.generated.h` in the right place, use valid Unreal reflection macros, never fabricate UE APIs/RPC behavior, and use server-authoritative gameplay. Map ecology simulation to Vibrance/Density/Harmony/Purity.

## Data architecture rules
ECO-API-001 should support Active Dex entries for 125 base production identities, Forms Registry entries for named variants/conditional states, and Historical Archive entries for prototypes, old names, rename candidates, and retired labels.

## Git, LFS, and CI rules
Clone existing repos; do not run `git init` inside an already-cloned canonical repo. Use feature branches. Use Git LFS for Unreal binary assets. Do not blindly ignore all `Build/` content. Close Unreal Editor before structural C++ changes. CI should be self-hosted/environment-variable driven for UE builds.

## Verification vocabulary
Use `STATIC CHECK PASSED`, `REPOSITORY CONTRACT PASSED`, `CI PREFLIGHT PASSED`, or `NOT VERIFIED — UE BUILD/RUNTIME EVIDENCE REQUIRED`. Never claim compiled, production-ready, optimized, secure, fixed, or VERIFIED without actual runtime/build evidence.

## Final instruction
When asked to create or fix code, inspect repo context, preserve canon, make the smallest correct change, explain verification status, and route work to the correct Echohearts folder or runtime module.

## C++ study, Echohearts compiler, and PR dependency contract — 2026-10-06

### C++ learning material
Use the user-supplied C++ tutorial videos and notes as learning/benchmark material for fundamentals such as editor/toolchain setup, variables and built-in types, input/output, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, compilation, linking, and debugging. Do not copy tutorial code into production merely because it compiles.

For production Echohearts code:
- prefer modern C++20-compatible practices where supported by the active UE5.8 toolchain;
- use RAII, const-correctness, explicit ownership/lifetime rules, bounded containers, deterministic initialization, and clear error handling;
- use Unreal types/macros/lifecycle where required by UObject reflection, replication, serialization, assets, delegates, Gameplay Tags, and engine subsystems;
- do not use `std::cin`/`std::cout` as gameplay UI/input; console Hello-World programs are toolchain smoke tests only;
- do not assume G++ is the shipping compiler on every target. Use the UE-supported compiler/toolchain for the actual platform.

### Echohearts compiler definition
"Echohearts Compiler" means the project-specific build/verification driver that validates repository contracts and orchestrates the real Unreal/C++ toolchain. It is NOT a replacement C++ compiler.

Authoritative executable implementation belongs in:
`Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-`

Preferred driver:
`BuildScripts/EchoheartsCompiler.py`

The driver may:
1. validate project/module/target naming;
2. validate required files and Git LFS state;
3. perform an optional standalone C++ compiler smoke test;
4. locate/validate the exact UE5.8 installation and Build.version;
5. invoke UnrealBuildTool and UnrealHeaderTool through supported UE entry points;
6. run bounded Automation tests;
7. cook/package an explicit authored map;
8. launch or hand off to an authorized runtime test;
9. retain command lines, exit codes, logs, source SHA, package metadata, and evidence manifests.

Do not write a custom C++ frontend/parser/code generator for the game unless the user explicitly requests a separate language-research project. Echohearts gameplay remains UE5.8 C++.

### Exit-code diagnosis
Never treat exit code 2 as a universal explanation. It is process/tool-specific. Read the failing command, interpreter/compiler output, working directory, checked-out ref, required-file preflight, path casing, arguments, and stderr/stdout immediately above the exit code before changing code or CI.

A passing shell/Python/static command proves only that command passed. It does not prove UHT, UE compilation, runtime, packaging, networking, save behavior, AI, gameplay, cross-play, target hardware, or publication rendering.

### PR #19 / PR #20 dependency boundary
For `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth`:
- PR #19 contains useful UE5.8 naming/build contracts but predates the repository-authority split. Executable runtime/compiler/tooling must be reconciled into the BUILD repository instead of creating a second runtime authority.
- BUILD PR #10 is the current executable Echohearts compiler/build-driver candidate.
- PR #20 platform/publication contracts are downstream of the executable foundation for runtime claims, but the EPUB contract lane is independent of UE runtime validation.
- Do not label any of these VERIFIED without the exact required evidence.

Safe runtime order:
`BUILD foundation/tooling → clean clone + LFS → UE5.8 UHT/Development Editor build → editor + minimal authored map + PIE → bounded Automation → Development package + packaged launch → Issue #10 humanoid + Eco-Kin runtime proof → 4–6 Eco-Kin slice → save/network/platform hardware validation → exact cross-play/cloud-save pairs`

Publication order:
`canon-reviewed manuscript → exact EPUB artifact → EPUBCheck/accessibility → named reader/device rendering → checksum/storefront evidence where applicable`

### Code-fix execution behavior
When asked to create or fix code:
- inspect the current repository, branch, implementation, tests, logs, and call sites first;
- search the seven Echohearts repositories before duplicating code;
- modify the repository that owns the implementation;
- repair the smallest coherent surface;
- update/add tests or validation with the fix;
- run every available static/CI check;
- preserve the 125-ID Permanent Dex, Vibrance/Density/Harmony/Purity, Anima-Link, Huma-Link where applicable, and all locked canon;
- report what passed and what remains NOT YET VERIFIED;
- never hide a failure, suppress a required check, or fabricate runtime evidence.



## C++ study source URLs and Copilot execution note — 2026-10-06

Use these user-supplied study references as C++/toolchain learning material, not as production code to copy blindly:
- https://youtu.be/kZqFS6ldMac?is=qo9eHn3vHv6peQgg
- https://youtu.be/uerEG_yigco?is=dpMs73KWFKDtBXuA
- https://youtu.be/Jnwm2DvmyPo?is=FV6-0VF5t6EjFTrx
- https://youtu.be/6y0bp-mnYU0?is=5U6tNS674LbakYU5

Study and apply the transferable fundamentals: editor/toolchain setup, preprocessing/compilation/linking, variables and built-in types, console I/O for standalone smoke tools, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, translation units, headers, ownership/lifetime, diagnostics, and debugging. For Unreal production code, translate those fundamentals into UE5.8 architecture rather than using beginner console patterns as gameplay code.

Compiler boundary:
- The Echohearts compiler is a project-specific build/verification driver, not a replacement C++ frontend or native machine-code compiler.
- UE5.8 production builds must go through UnrealBuildTool/UnrealHeaderTool and the UE-supported platform compiler/toolchain.
- The executable compiler/build-driver candidate is BUILD PR #10: https://github.com/Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-/pull/10
- Public PR #19 contains foundation contracts that must not become a competing executable runtime authority: https://github.com/Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/pull/19
- Public PR #20 is downstream for runtime/platform claims, while its EPUB validation lane remains independent: https://github.com/Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/pull/20

Error-diagnosis rule: never infer a universal meaning from exit code 2. Read the exact failing tool, command, arguments, working directory, stdout/stderr, and preceding diagnostics. Exit code 0 proves only that the invoked process succeeded; it does not automatically verify gameplay, runtime behavior, save/network correctness, performance, cross-play, target hardware, or publication rendering.

GitHub Copilot rule: keep repository-wide guidance in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; use `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for path-specific C++/Unreal/build guidance where useful. Before changing code, inspect the owning repository, current branch, existing implementation, call sites, tests, workflows, and verification boundary. Fix the smallest coherent root cause and preserve evidence.

### User-supplied C++ / dependency references
Study these only as technical learning/benchmark inputs; repository contracts and UE5.8 evidence remain authoritative:
- https://youtu.be/kZqFS6ldMac
- https://youtu.be/uerEG_yigco
- https://youtu.be/Jnwm2DvmyPo
- https://youtu.be/6y0bp-mnYU0
- https://github.com/Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/pull/19
- https://github.com/Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/pull/20

Do not copy tutorial/demo architecture blindly into Unreal production. Extract C++ language lessons, compiler/debugging practices, and error-diagnosis techniques, then adapt them to the active Echohearts module, UE5.8 build pipeline, tests, and verification boundary.

## Unified Echohearts creation and code-repair directive — 2026-10-06

This repository participates in one Echohearts: Rebearth production family. GitHub Copilot must help **create requested game work and repair code**, but it must do so inside the established ownership boundaries and evidence gates.

### Repository family and authority
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` = canon/story/design/system-contract authority.
- `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-` = executable UE5.8 runtime/build/evidence authority.
- `Dlomotion/echohearts-web` = web/presentation/support surface.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Ecokins` = Eco-Kin support/archive/specialized content.
- `Dlomotion/ECO-KIN-Game`, `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-`, and `Dlomotion/Echohearts` = legacy/prototype/support repositories.

When a task spans repositories, inspect all relevant implementations before writing code. Modify the repository that owns the behavior. Do not create duplicate runtime modules, duplicate GDDs, duplicate Dexes, duplicate canon, duplicate save schemas, duplicate networking stacks, or parallel build pipelines.

### Locked game identity
Preserve:
- Planet: **Rebearth**.
- Creature class: **Eco-Kin**.
- Player class language: **Frequency Tamer / Core-Binder**.
- Apex entity: **Nature**, a Legendary Humanoid-Kin with conditional Mutations; never "Legendary Monarch".
- Core attributes: **Vibrance, Density, Harmony, Purity**.
- **Anima-Link** for Eco-Kin bi-directional combat strain/damage and **Huma-Link** for Humanoid-Kin synchronization/consequence.
- **A.E.G.I.S.** / Link Device as the rhythm/trust/consent bond and survival/combat interface.
- 125-ID Permanent Dex as production roster authority; historical/prototype names remain quarantined until approved.
- Campaign combat is real-time third-person. Resonance Arena can use its own tactical rules.
- Current party direction: carry up to 8 Eco-Kin, 3 active in battle, no duplicates, subject to current canon/data contracts.
- Target runtime: **Unreal Engine 5.8 C++** with Blueprint-facing data/assets and secure cross-platform save/profile boundaries.

Candidate story/system intake such as Meridian ancient technology, Meridian Nodes/pyramids, Time-Echo ruins, E.C.O. Sentinel, Cosmo-Seraph/AstraVore-class cosmic material, gardens/care, relic/idol concepts, fusion/reversion ideas, and branching endings must be reconciled against current canon before implementation. Do not let an older draft overwrite current source-of-truth documents.

### Code creation and repair behavior
Before changing code:
1. Read nearest repository/Copilot instructions and authoritative project docs.
2. Inspect the actual failing file, call sites, tests, build scripts, workflows, branch, and open related PR/issues.
3. Reproduce or precisely identify the failure from compiler/UHT/UBT/UAT/test/runtime/log evidence when available.
4. Search current official documentation and reputable public GitHub samples/issues when needed; adapt principles, never copy proprietary code or franchise identity.
5. Fix the smallest coherent root cause. Preserve working APIs and save/data compatibility unless migration is explicitly required.
6. Add or update tests/validation with the fix.
7. Run every validation available in the repository.
8. Report exactly what passed and what remains **NOT YET VERIFIED**.

Never hide errors, disable required checks to make CI green, fabricate engine APIs, invent build success, or describe code as perfect/production-ready without evidence.

### Language ownership
- **C++**: UE5.8 production gameplay/runtime, replication, AI, systems, save/network logic.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: web and browser/tooling surfaces; prefer TypeScript for maintainability.
- **Python**: build helpers, validators, data/content processing, automation, evidence tooling.
- **C#**: legacy/prototype/supporting tooling only unless an authority document explicitly assigns a production responsibility. It must not silently replace UE5.8 C++.

### Engineering quality gates
Audit as applicable: UHT/reflection syntax, module and Build.cs dependencies, API macros, UObject lifetime, ownership/authority, RPC validation, prediction/reconciliation, replication relevancy/dormancy, finite/bounds checks, stable IDs, serialization/version migration, threading/UObject access, async asset loading, World Partition, performance/memory, accessibility, security/anti-cheat surfaces, packaging, platform behavior, cloud/save boundaries, UI event bindings, AI/StateTree/Behavior Trees, animation/VFX/audio hooks, and data/schema integrity.

Trace major gameplay work end-to-end:
**input -> authority -> state mutation -> replication/save -> UI/VFX/audio feedback**.

### Game-creation behavior
Every new feature must connect to existing gameplay, story, world state, quests, Eco-Kin ecology, UI/UX, audio/VFX, progression, save/network behavior, or production tracking. Avoid feature dumps that cannot be implemented or verified. Keep all visual/narrative/gameplay work original to Echohearts; outside games are benchmark material only and never production nomenclature or creative identity.

### Evidence vocabulary
Use:
- `STATIC CHECK PASSED`
- `REPOSITORY CONTRACT PASSED`
- `CI PREFLIGHT PASSED`
- `NOT VERIFIED — UE BUILD/RUNTIME EVIDENCE REQUIRED`

Only use `VERIFIED` when the specific claim is backed by the required build/test/runtime/profile evidence.
